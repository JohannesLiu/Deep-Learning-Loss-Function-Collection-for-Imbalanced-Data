# Deep-Learning-Loss-Function-Collection-for-Imbalanced-Data

This repo is a collection of loss functions, that aim to solve the imbalanced classification problem.

* Class Balanced Loss
* Corss Entropy Loss
* CSCE
* Distribution Focal Loss
* Flocal Loss
* Gaussian Focal Loss
* GHM Loss
* LDAM Loss
* Quality Focal Loss
* Resample Loss

Some implementations refer to the open source code of the original paper, and we will give a reference link later.
